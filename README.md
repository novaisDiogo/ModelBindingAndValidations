# Model Validation in .NET

## Project Goal:

This repository aims to explore and demonstrate effective model validation techniques in .NET using both built-in data annotations and custom validation logic.

## Key Features:

- **Data Annotations**: Explore various data annotation attributes for validating model properties.
- **Custom Validation**: Implement custom validation rules to enforce specific business logic not covered by built-in attributes.
- **Code Examples**: Provide clear and concise code examples for both data annotation and custom validation scenarios.
- **Best Practices**: Share insights and recommendations for robust model validation in .NET applications.
